            <p>Three hundred years after the establishment of the first colony on the Moon, humankind is ready to get to the next frontier: Mars. <br>
                <br>
            However, the new Mars Landing rocket is very expensive, and it will require a huge amount of the ultra-rare space mineral Iridium to be funded. <br>
            <br>
            Use the arrow keys to help Major Tom travel through space in search of Iridium rocks. 
            Each rocket part has a cost of $1,000,000. If this amount is collected, it will be inmediately invested in the construction of the rocket. <br>
            <br>
            Avoid the meteorites!
